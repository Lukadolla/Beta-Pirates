## Old Files added in previous Sprints
- testController.java - used for testing new implementations and ideas without affecting old working ones. 
- main.fxml - contains fxml for the application main window.
- help.txt - a file containing useful information for the user on how to use the application.
- help.fxml - simple stage where the help.txt will be displayed to the user.
-test.fxml - used to test new implementations in the layout of the application without breaking/interfering with already working features.
- resource folder- added icon for the application in the top left conrner once launched.
- Controller.java - contains functionality for saving/loading, editing and deleting a panel from the bottom section of the application.
- testController.java - used for testing new implementations and ideas without affecting old working ones. 
- Character.java - a class containing data of each new character object such as their hair colour, gender etc.
- ImageLists.java - a class that contains the list of all character images and background images as well as a method to access them from the controller which has been 
edited. 
- Comic.java - a class that contains data of the current state of the comic such as which pannel currently has which character etc.  
- TextGraphic.java - experimental class which will be used in future to convert text to images. 
- directoryList.txt - a text file which contains the paths of images in the resources/images/characters folder. This is used in order to allow the jar to reference 
 the character images correctly without crashing
 - backgroundList.txt - a text file which contains the paths of images in the resources/images/backgrounds folder. This is used in order to allow the jar to reference 
 the background images correctly without crashing
 - TestImageLists - a method that tests the ImageLists class (work in progress).
 -ButtonController.java - Contains functionality relating to the buttons in the application
- CharacterController.java - Contains functionality relating to changing the state of the character image (excluding colours).
- ColourController.java - Contains functionality relating to changing colours and colour alteration/checking
- ComicController.java - Contains functionality for inserting images into the comic panel.
- LowerPanelController.java - Contains functionality for the bottom section of the application responsible for saving/loading/deleting and displaying the saved 
  panels.
- MidScrollPaneController.java - Contains functionality for the middle panel of the application which displays all available characters and backgrounds. 


## New Files added/updated in Sprint 7
- Controller.java - contains instances of all controllers, proxy methods for fxml functions and runs the main application 
- testController.java - used for testing new implementations and ideas without affecting old working ones. 
- main.fxml - contains fxml for the application main window.
- LoadComicCOntroller.java - contains functionality for loading in the comic in XML format.
- SaveComicCOntroller.java - contains functionality for saving the comic in XML format.
-test.fxml - used to test new implementations in the layout of the application without breaking/interfering with already working features.
- help.txt - a file containing useful information for the user on how to use the application.
- help.fxml - simple stage where the help.txt will be displayed to the user.

 
## Instructions on setting up and running the project
Java version: 8
JUnit version: 4

The following link outlines ways to set up the JavaFX project if versions other than Java 8 are used. You will need to add a library which is pointing to the lib file of the JavaFX SDK as well as edit the VM options (The VM options only need to be edited if a version other than Java 8 is used). The link walks through this process for a variety of IDEs and Java versions.
https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/

For IntelliJ users: File >> Project Structure >> Libraries >> '+' icon and navigate to the lib file of your Java SDK

To edit VM options: Run >> Edit Configurations >> Enter relevant command from the article into the VM options box.

We have created a .jar file in the root directory of the project which runs when ran from inside an IDE like Intellij as well as command line. Navigate to the root 
project folder and use the command: java -jar Beta_Pirates.jar. It still runs from within the IDE which can be done by right clicking on the .jar file and selecting 
"Run Beta_Pirates.jar".

In order to make the JUnit test class work, add junit/junit/4.12 to the class path. IDES like IntelliJ should prompt to do this automatically when you hover over
the Test annotations or import statements.

## General Info about implementation of Sprint 7

Once you have the comic saved as a series of panels in the bottom section of the application, you can save the comic as XML. To do so, go to File >> Save as XML. Once 
you select that option, a prompt will appear asking for the name of the new file. Following that, you will be asked to choose a directory to save the file to. Once 
you choose the directory, press save and the file will be saved there. You can then load this file by going to File >> Load XML where you can navigate to the XML file 
and open it. The content of the XML will be loaded into the bottom panel where you can edit/delete panels as well as add new ones. 

For more information on how the program works, go to the help menu in the application.
