## Old Files added in previous Sprints
- testController.java - used for testing new implementations and ideas without affecting old working ones. 
- main.fxml - contains fxml for the application main window.
- help.txt - a file containing useful information for the user on how to use the application.
- help.fxml - simple stage where the help.txt will be displayed to the user.
-test.fxml - used to test new implementations in the layout of the application without breaking/interfering with already working features.
- resource folder- added icon for the application in the top left conrner once launched.
- Controller.java - contains functionality for changing the character's gender as well as their hair/body colour using colour picker as well as new way to insert
  characters via a selection scroll pane in middle pannel. 
- testController.java - used for testing new implementations and ideas without affecting old working ones. 
- Character.java - a class containing data of each new character object such as their hair colour, gender etc.
- CharacterList.java - a class that contains the list of all character images as well as a method to access them from the controller.
- Comic.java - a class that contains data of the current state of the comic such as which pannel currently has which character etc.  
- TextGraphic.java - experimental class which will be used in future to convert text to images. 
- directoryList.txt - a text file which contains the paths of images in the resources/images/characters folder. This is used in order to allow the jar to reference 
 the character images correctly without crashing


## New Files added/updated in Sprint 5

- testController.java - used for testing new implementations and ideas without affecting old working ones. 
- main.fxml - contains fxml for the application main window.
-test.fxml - used to test new implementations in the layout of the application without breaking/interfering with already working features.
- help.txt - a file containing useful information for the user on how to use the application.
- help.fxml - simple stage where the help.txt will be displayed to the user.
- ImageLists.java - a class that contains the list of all character images and background images as well as a method to access them from the controller which has been 
edited. 
- backgroundList.txt - a text file which contains the paths of images in the resources/images/backgrounds folder. This is used in order to allow the jar to reference 
 the background images correctly without crashing
 - TestImageLists - a method that tests the ImageLists class (work in progress).
 
 
## Instructions on setting up and running the project
Java version: 8
JUnit version: 4

The following link outlines ways to set up the JavaFX project if versions other than Java 8 are used. You will need to add a library which is pointing to the lib file of the JavaFX SDK as well as edit the VM options (The VM options only need to be edited if a version other than Java 8 is used). The link walks through this process for a variety of IDEs and Java versions.
https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/

For IntelliJ users: File >> Project Structure >> Libraries >> '+' icon and navigate to the lib file of your Java SDK

To edit VM options: Run >> Edit Configurations >> Enter relevant command from the article into the VM options box.

We have created a .jar file in the root directory of the project which runs when ran from inside an IDE like Intellij as well as command line. Navigate to the root 
project folder and use the command: java -jar Beta_Pirates.jar. It still runs from within the IDE which can be done by right clicking on the .jar file and selecting 
"Run Beta_Pirates.jar".

In order to make the JUnit test class work, add junit/junit/4.12 to the class path. IDES like IntelliJ should prompt to do this automatically when you hover over
the Test annotations or import statements.

## General Info about implementation of Sprint 5

Once the application is launched, the user can input narrative text above and below the panel in the text fields provided. We also implemented the ability to add 
backgrounds to the comic panel. To do so, press the background button in the bottom right corner and select a background from the middle panel which will be updated
with the available background images. To go back to character selection, press either the left or right add character button. When hovered over, the buttons will 
display a tip as to what their function is.

For more information on how the program works, go to the help menu in the application.
