## Old Files added in previous Sprints
- testController.java - used for testing new implementations and ideas without affecting old working ones. 
- main.fxml - contains fxml for the application main window.
- help.txt - a file containing useful information for the user on how to use the application.
- help.fxml - simple stage where the help.txt will be displayed to the user.
- -test.fxml - used to test new implementations in the layout of the application without breaking/interfering with already working features.
- resource folder- added icon for the application in the top left conrner once launched.
- Controller.java - contains functionality for changing the character's gender as well as their hair/body colour using colour picker as well as new way to insert
  characters via a selection scroll pane in middle pannel. 
- testController.java - used for testing new implementations and ideas without affecting old working ones. 
- Character.java - a class containing data of each new character object such as their hair colour, gender etc.
- CharacterList.java - a class that contains the list of all character images as well as a method to access them from the controller.
- Comic.java - a class that contains data of the current state of the comic such as which pannel currently has which character etc.  


## New Files added/updated in Sprint 4
- Controller.java - contains functionality for adding in thought/speech balloons to the characters.
- testController.java - used for testing new implementations and ideas without affecting old working ones. 
- main.fxml - contains fxml for the application main window.
- help.txt - a file containing useful information for the user on how to use the application.
- help.fxml - simple stage where the help.txt will be displayed to the user.
- CharacterList.java - a class that contains the list of all character images as well as a method to access them from the controller which has been edited. 
- TextGraphic.java - experimental class which will be used in future to convert text to images.
- directoryList.txt - a text file which contains the paths of images in the resources/images/characters folder. This is used in order to allow the jar to reference 
 the images correctly without crashing
 
## Instructions on setting up and running the project
Java version: 8

The following link outlines ways to set up the JavaFX project if versions other than Java 8 are used. You will need to add a library which is pointing to the lib file of the JavaFX SDK as well as edit the VM options (The VM options only need to be edited if a version other than Java 8 is used). The link walks through this process for a variety of IDEs and Java versions.
https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/

For IntelliJ users: File >> Project Structure >> Libraries >> '+' icon and navigate to the lib file of your Java SDK

To edit VM options: Run >> Edit Configurations >> Enter relevant command from the article into the VM options box.

We have created a .jar file in the root directory of the project which runs when ran from inside an IDE like Intellij as well as command line. Navigate to the root project folder and use the command: java -jar Beta_Pirates.jar. It still runs from within the IDE which can be done by right clicking on the .jar file and selecting "Run Beta_Pirates.jar".

## General Info about implementation of Sprint 4

Once a character has been selected by either clicking on the area or pressing the character insertion button, the buttons to add a though/speech bubble will be 
enabled. In order to add a thought/speech bubble, press one of the corresponding buttons which will make an area appear where text can be typed. We have also implemented a delete button which can be used to remove the current character from the pannel as well as any text he/she is saying.

We also implemented a directoryList.txt which contains the paths of the character image pngs. The list acts as a reference for the program to find the images. This 
method also enables the jar to run independently without crashing as it had problems with finding the image paths. This is the solution we found as we had problems with this in the past and it appears that it is one of the better ways of making file paths work within a jar file.
