- resource folder- contains character poses and button images

## General Info about implementation of Sprint 1

The application is launched by running the Main.java file. This launches the application defined in main.fxml in a fullscreeen window. The main window is divided into 4 main sections. The top left section contains a 2x2 GridPane and will be used to insert the characters and text when a user creates a comic pannel. The 2 other sections to the right contain the button layout defined in the brief as well as extra space for adding additional features later like the ability to change character colours etc. The bottom most section will be used to display the sereis of comic pannels the user has created. The applications also contains a menu bar with various save options as well as view and configure, as defined in the whitepaper. The buttons are stored in a GridPane which dynamically resizes as the user resizes the screen. The buttons also have this functionality. The size of each of the 4 main sections can be changed to whatever size the user wishes.
